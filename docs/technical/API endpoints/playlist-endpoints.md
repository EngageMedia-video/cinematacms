## 🔐 Security & Privacy Notes

### Enhanced Playlist Access (CinemataCMS 2.0+)

The Enhanced Playlist Access feature maintains strict security principles:

**🔒 What Stays Protected:**
- Private videos are never visible in playlists
- Restricted videos still require passwords for playback
- Unlisted videos still require authentication for playback
- Video privacy settings are never bypassed

**✅ What's Enhanced:**
- Trusted users can organize unlisted/restricted content in playlists
- Authenticated users can see thumbnails of all non-private videos
- Playlist visibility doesn't grant video playback access

### User Roles Defined

- **Regular User**: Standard authenticated user
- **Trusted User**: User with `advancedUser` attribute enabled
- **Editor**: User with editor privileges (`is_editor`)
- **Manager**: User with manager privileges (`is_manager`) 
- **Superuser**: User with superuser privileges (`is_superuser`)

### Privacy States

- **Public**: Accessible to everyone, including anonymous users
- **Unlisted**: Requires authentication, not listed publicly
- **Restricted**: Requires authentication + password for playback
- **Private**: Only accessible to owner and site administrators
