## 🔐 Privacy & Security Features

### Playlist Visibility vs. Video Access
**Important:** Seeing a video thumbnail in a playlist ≠ being able to play it

- **Playlist visibility** shows what videos are in a collection
- **Video access** controls whether you can actually watch the content
- **Password protection** is maintained for restricted videos
- **Authentication requirements** are preserved for unlisted videos

### Best Practices for Content Creators

#### Using Restricted Videos in Playlists
- Add password-protected videos to playlists for better organization
- Viewers will see the video exists but need the password to watch
- Useful for premium content, works-in-progress, or sensitive material

#### Using Unlisted Videos in Playlists  
- Great for organizing content not meant for public discovery
- Viewers must be logged in to see these videos in playlists
- Perfect for member-only content or limited distribution

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a regular user. Why can't I add an unlisted video to my playlist?
**A:** Only Trusted Users and above can add unlisted/restricted videos to playlists. Contact [curators@cinemata.org](mailto:curators@cinemata.org) to learn about becoming a Trusted User.

**A:** The video requires a password for playback. Contact the video owner for access credentials.

### Q: Can I make my entire playlist private?
**A:** Playlists themselves follow standard privacy rules, but individual videos maintain their own privacy settings within the playlist.
